# Predicting-Yelp-Scores

Dining out is a hallmark of human culture. It is a hobby, recreation, and a vessel that fosters community amongst friends and family. In addition, the restaurant industry plays a major role in the US economy. This year, in 2019, there are over 1 million U.S. restaurants which combined are expected to produce over $863 billion in revenue. Over the next ten years, the restaurant industry is expected to produce over 1.6 million new jobs and employ 10% of the overall U.S. workforce. So what is associated with a good restaurant? 

There is an obvious answer to this question. Good food is associated with a good restaurant. But there is more to a restaurant than the quality of its food. Restaurants differ in the cuisines they offer, the number of dietary restrictions they accommodates, and the amenities they offer. For the purposes of this project, we were interested in building an application that would allow a soon-to-be restaurant owner to predict the yelp score of their future restaurant. An interesting secondary use of our application would be for existing restaurant owners to tinker with inputs to determine what changes are likely to improve or hurt their yelp rating. 


To build this predictive model, we utilized the largest restaurant review dataset: Yelp. The specific dataset we downloaded can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gd1k41y9gbpfwq3/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json?dl=0. 

This dropbox file links to an older Yelp dataset challenge. For each data challenge, Yelp modifies what data is available to view. For our particular problem statement, we wanted as many attributes regarding restaurants as possible. Therefore we decided to use an older data challenge data set.
*Before running our rmd file it is important to download the file from the link above and drag it into the project directory (when it asks you to replace file, hit okay). Because this file is too large for github to handle it will not be fully pulled into the relevant directory.*
